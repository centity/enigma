This code aims to simulate a WWII Enigma Machine as accurately as possible using c++ and OOP.

To summarise the working mechanism briefly; a userâ€™s input is taken via an electrical path through a plugboard, several rotors, a reflector, and back through the rotors and plugboard via a different path to a lamp. Every letter of the alphabet has a corresponding lamp which lights up to indicate the output of the encryption. Each component added to the complexity of the machine but it was the rotors which rotated at different rates which casued the dynamic behaviour of the encryption.
